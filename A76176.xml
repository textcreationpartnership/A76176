            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Earle of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øey</hi> I ≈øaw brought dead under his wounds, into <hi>Warwicke</hi> Ca≈øtle upon Tue≈øday night, the Lord <hi>John,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> was ≈ølain in the fight. The Kings red Regiment of 12. hundred men, mo≈øt of them Gentlemen, were fir≈øt routed by my Lord Generals Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of Gentlemen, and then abundantly ≈ømitten downe by the Orange Coats, and Sir <hi>William Con≈øtable</hi> his blew Coats, one of who≈øe En≈øignes, Mr. <hi>Young</hi> by name, had the fir≈øt honour of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Kings Standard, which afterwards an hor≈øeman got into his hands, and rid away with it to the Lord Generall, who bravely flouri≈øhed it in the field, and then gave it his Secretary, Ma≈øter <hi>Chambers</hi> to keep, and how he lo≈øt it I know not. There are ≈ølaine on the Kings ≈øide at lea≈øt ten for one, though well nigh three parts of tho≈øe who are ≈ølaine on our ≈øide were Waggoners, Carters, and poore unarmed people that ≈øtood in the Reere to ≈øee the fight, ≈øome of them old men, women and Children, a poore piece of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for ≈øuch a boa≈øting enemy. It is reported that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was ≈øo wi≈øe as not to come neare much danger, but in ≈øtead of fighting, ≈øpent his time in pillaging our Noble mens Waggons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde our Army. We have many men ≈øoarely wounded, but it was more with flying, then fighting. The Earle of <hi>Bullingbrooke</hi> his ≈øon, <hi>alias,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sanit-Johns</hi> was the chiefe man that was ≈ølain on our ≈øide, who≈øe body is now embalmed, and prepared for

an interment: Colonell <hi>Charles E≈ø≈øex</hi> was buryed with the ≈øolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Souldier in a Church at <hi>Warwicke</hi> on Wedne≈øday (which was your Fa≈øt day, but by the command of his Excellency was our day of thankfulne≈ø≈øe) his Corps was borne to the grave by the Lord <hi>Mandevill,</hi> the Lord <hi>Brooke,</hi> and ≈øome foure or ≈øix other Colonels. On Munday the King ≈øent an Herauld of Armes to his Excellency, ≈øome ≈øay the me≈ø≈øage was to offer a generall pardon upon laying downe of Armes &amp;c. And the an≈øwer, That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament mu≈øt determine what in this ca≈øe ≈øhould be done, but I cannot confidently ≈øpeake this. When the left Wing of our Hor≈øe (which were mo≈øt of our hor≈øe which we chiefly relyed upon) fled, and likewi≈øe the Gunners which on that part of the Army ≈øhould have played upon the enemy, almo≈øt 5. Regiments of the foote on the right Wing fled ≈øoone after. The Lord <hi>Mandevils</hi> men would not ≈øtand the field, though his Lord≈øhip be≈øeeched them, yea, cudgelled them: no nor yet the Lord <hi>Whartons</hi> men: Sir <hi>William Fairefax</hi> his whole Regiment, as I heard, and all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Chomley</hi> his Regiment, except ≈øome 80. of them, u≈øed their heeles. It is ≈øhrewdly ≈øu≈øpected that there was treachery in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, for the Souldiers ≈øweare that their Commanders ran fir≈øt, and bid their ≈øouldiers run too, after farther examination I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe you will heare more. Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment of red-Coates, under God did mo≈øt gallant ≈øervice, every one fighting like a Lion, with ≈øuch a glorious ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, that by the help of the Lord <hi>Brookes</hi> purple-Coats, they won the field, &amp; crowned a mo≈øt bloody battle with an honourable victory: and yet I mu≈øt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to tell you that the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> his red-Coats, and the Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> blew-Coats, together with part of Colonell <hi>Ballards</hi> gray-Coats, did good ≈øervice. In generall the right Wing of the hor≈øe, and the left wing of the foote bore the brunt of the day, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victory. If I ≈øhould relate how admirably the hand of Providence ordered our Artillery and Bullets for the de≈øtruction of the enemy, but how ≈øeldome or never almo≈øt we were hurt by theirs, you would ≈øtand and wonder: tho≈øe that rid mo≈øt gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among an hundred thou≈øand bullets, and faced, and charged the enemy; where fir≈øt his Excellency, the Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Balfore,</hi> Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> Commander of the Lord <hi>Say</hi>
